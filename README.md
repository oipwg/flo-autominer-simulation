This is the source code of simulation of the FLO environment with OIP autominer governance software. The objective of this project is to build a test bed for different scenarios where we can test the distribution of fees generated by the use of OIP in order to secure the network by adding extra incentive to miners.

### Under construction notice

This project is under construction and it is an experiment in building opensource projects from scratch.

## The FLO ecosystem

`FLO` is a javascript class that mimics the environment of the FLO network. It has no influence in the real FLO environment (even the testnet).  

Now, if we want to simulate a crypto system, we first needs to define a few parameters. For example, what is the block difficulty, the time for a block to be processed, the block reward. We also need to tell the simulation about the market, such as prices and etc. Finally, we need to define the protocol.

We separated these in three categories and they are all loaded independently when a new instance of `FLO` is initiated.

The constructor of the FLO class takes three objects. One with parameters that defines the network parameters (`configFLO.js`), one that defines the protocol parameters (`configProtocol.js`) and another that defines market parameters (`configMarket.js`). While any parameter can be adjusted at any time, the constructor sets the initial conditions for the simulation.
